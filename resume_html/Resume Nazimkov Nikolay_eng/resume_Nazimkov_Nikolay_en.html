            <h2>Other skills:</h2>
            <p>
In 2012 he graduated from the graduate school with a degree in Environmental Safety and passed the candidate minimum. Repeatedly participated in exhibitions and conferences on geodesic topics (GEOFORUM Lviv Ukraine, InterGEO Frankfurt am Main Germany). I have an idea of ​​modern methods for performing geodetic work with drones (quadrocopters) and high-precision laser scanners. I have a driving license category "B". During his work, he was awarded diplomas for the Day of Metallurgical and Mining Industry Workers, as well as cash prizes for his active participation in the "Bank of Ideas" corporate project. At the moment I am a student at BeetRoot Academy Kremenchug in the direction "Front-End Development"
